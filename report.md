## Introduction

Online shopping has grown in popularity in recent years as more and more consumers use the Internet to purchase goods and services. As a result, the demand for efficient and easy-to-use online store systems is also increasing. In response to this need, I developed an online store system using the Java programming language. This report describes the design and implementation of an online shopping system and its features and functionality. It also highlights challenges faced during the development process and provides recommendations for future improvements.

## Design and implementation

The classes UMLs are as the followings:

[Wallet](umls/wallet.pdf)

## Bonus tasks

1. Designed GUI for program using JavaFX
2. Created notification system for users
3. Implementated rating system for products
4. Implementated simple commenting system for products
5. Created search option to easily find products
6. Used file-based saving data
7. Created a histry of sales and transactions for sellers

## Testing and Evaluation

In order to test my program, I have created a class named `test` and I wrote a few instances of each class and then added them to my `OnlineShop` class to see if for diffrent inputs, the progrom runs as it was expected.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the online shopping system I developed using the Java programming language is an efficient yet simple management system that could be extended and be used in real world. The system provides administrators with the tools they need to effectively run their online stores, while offering a wide range of features that enhance the basic shopping features for their customers. Throughout the development process, we faced several challenges such as [insert some challenges]. Going forward, we recommend that future enhancements to the system include adding payment options, improving the user interface, and implementing analytical tools for sellers to keep track of their products. Overall, we found this online shop system to be a valuable addition for businesses looking to expand their reach and increase sales through their online platform.
